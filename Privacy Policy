## 7. Security
We take reasonable measures to protect user data, including:

Data is retained only as long as:

If the bot is removed from a server, activity stops; stored data remains until removed manually or by administrator request.

Continued use of Sacred Grounds after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
